# Phase A — Decide the MVP interaction

**Duration**: 1 hour  
**Source**: `faithtech-readmes/deliverables/01-code-switching.md`

---

## Goal

Confirm the default interaction model and constraints before building the evaluation set.

---

## Tasks

- [ ] **A1**: Confirm default interaction model (async voice notes, WhatsApp-style)
- [ ] **A2**: Confirm constraints:
  - [ ] Cloud OK vs PII restricted vs offline/on-device
  - [ ] Map to scoping gates in `faithtech-readmes/research/03-scoping-thinking-tree.md`

---

## Output

Decision documented in project notes or scoping document.

## Next Steps

After Phase A is complete, proceed to:
- **[T1 — Top 20 Code-Switching Patterns](t1-patterns.md)**
- **[T2 — Audio Sample Pack](t2-audio-pack.md)**
