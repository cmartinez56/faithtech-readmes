# D01.T1 — Top 20 code-switching patterns list

**Output file**: `deliverables/01-code-switching.patterns.md` (create)

## Checklist

- [ ] Create the table skeleton with required columns:
  - Pattern name
  - Example utterances (3–5)
  - Languages mixed (Ar+En / Ar+Fr / Ar+En+Fr)
  - Where it happens (greetings/logistics/fear/prayer/medical/bureaucracy/conflict)
  - STT failure mode
  - Normalization rule (optional)
  - Priority (P0/P1/P2)
- [ ] Collect/brainstorm candidate patterns (aim for 30–40) from:
  - translation/linguistics team memory + field partner input
  - notes in `research/`
- [ ] Down-select to top 20 using harm-based prioritization:
  - P0: triage/urgent/safety-critical misunderstandings
  - P1: high-frequency, high-confusion patterns
  - P2: nice-to-have coverage
- [ ] For each pattern, write 3–5 "voice note style" examples (verbatim, not MSA-cleaned).
- [ ] Add an explicit STT failure mode per pattern (what breaks today).
- [ ] Add optional normalization guidance (when we prefer consistent representation).
- [ ] Review with Engineering/ML to ensure patterns are testable.
